            <h3>From San Francisco</h3>
            <p>Take the Bay Bridge to Interstate 80, head east toward
Sacramento/Reno. Just before you reach Donner Summit look
for the "Sugar Bowl Next Exit" sign then exit at the
Norden/Soda Springs off ramp. Turn right on Donner Pass rd.
eastbound, and continue 2.5 miles. Just past the Clair Tappaan
Lodge on your left, your next exit will be the Cal Lodge.  We
have a green roof and sit up on the hill to the left.  You know you
have gone too far if you reach the Gondola parking lot for Sugar
Bowl, if so turn around and we are the first big driveway to the
right, park in the lot on the left.  In the winter months you must
park at the bottom of the hill in the large parking lot and walk
up about 75 feet to our lodge.  Please DO NOT leave any
valuables in your vehicle at anytime, bring everything into the
lodge.</p>
